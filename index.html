<h1>Interest in IT:</h1>
What sparks my main interest in IT is that it influences our current lives for the better and will progressively do so in our future. 
I started with IT in the 80s, programming in Basic and Cobol. In the 80s there were hardly any IT specialist around, which meant you had to resolve issues on your own. Back in those days, there wasn’t as much room for error as computers weren’t as reliable and stable as they are nowadays. I always have been interested in IT and RMIT offered a very good range of IT courses to update my knowledge. I just finished introduction into programming. What l like about RMIT is that the whole course is online, so I can study from Germany as well as from Australia.

<h1>My ideal Job:</h1>
The ideal job for me can be found in the link below:
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/40474943?type=standout#searchRequestToken=dacf1ef8-56b3-490d-a300-82d1c9611679">Lead Machine Learning Enggineer</a>
The Woolworths Group has a retail background as well as me. Retailing will dramatically change in the upcoming years and AI will play a key role 
in this. Big Data and Machine Learning will secure a future success in retailing. As a candidate I will have profound knowledge about data structures, as well as computer languages such as Python or object orientated programming. A very important part of the job will be to analyse information from websites of competitors and compare these statistics with the company data, such as prices and services.
My retailing background will help me to understand the objectives, especially to explain projects to staff of the company. In the upcoming years I will learn about AI (a subsidiary Ode Amazon supplies very good programming tools and learn Python and other Java script)

<h1>Personal Profile:</h1>
My first Personality Test I did on the TypeFinder Website:



These personality tests do not mean much to me. I think that humans are too individual than to be categorized in certain groups by algorithms.
I do not think that these results will influence my behaviour in the team. It is more important to talk to people and find out their weakness and strengths. Then try to let ideally do every team member, what he or she enjoys most. Encourage everyone to achieve the targets the team is aiming for.










<h1>Project Idea:</h1>

Vision test for your eyes with a smart phone.

An eye test, which is currently performed by an optometrist could be done with a smart phone. The optometrist asks whether the vision is better or worse, after changing lenses. The optometrist depends on the answers of the patient. However, the patients can do this test by themselves by looking into the camera of a smart phone. The program/technique would consist of different images being presented and they would answer the question whether the image, which correlates with strength of lenses, is better or worse. With the help of a clever software the patient will get the values for their eyes. This project will be useful, because it will enable the optometrist to concentrate on more complex tests. The amount of patients will increase in the next decade, since the population will become more and more short-sighted and in addition they are also aging. There will be a lack of optometrist very soon. The optometrist can concentrate more on specific vision tests, since the patient or the nurses are doing the routine tests. 

The vision test apps could be used in third world countries, since smart phones are available around the world. This will give even people in a third world country the opportunity at a better way of life.

For the vision test app we will need a smart phone with a good camera. Inside the smart phone is a torch. The distance patients’ eye to camera must be calibrated and constant. The torch should be activated for a very short time (about a second) by the patient or nurse. The light of the torch travels through the pupil of the patient’s eye to the retina (back part of the eye with all relevant cells for vision). The light will be reflected on the retina and travels back. 

The camera will register the reflected light and more importantly the quality of how it is reflected. Through the distance of the camera – eye of patient and quality of reflected image, an algorithm can calculate the power of the lens and the patient’s needs. This value will be displayed on the screen.

In the next step the nurse will put the strength of the lens into a test frame. This described method is called a objective measurement. 
The second step is the subjective measurement and this is the more important and final step. But the subjective measurement is based on the objective 
measurement. You can compare this step in a way with fine tuning.
In this step numbers and symbols of different sizes are presented. The size of these symbols are correlating with the visus (international scale of the 
quality of vision). The patient has to read the symbols and the nurse puts a lenses +-0.5 dpt into the test frame asking whether the vision becomes 
better or worse. If it becomes worse she repeats the procedure with a+-0.25 dpt lens. This procedure is easy to learn. 
Both steps have to be done with the other eye. At the end we get the power of the lens the patient needs.
The programming might be done with the MIT App inventor. This tool will enable us to create numbers and symbols of different sizes. The complicated 
part of programming is the calculation of the values of the first step. The program needs to interpret the reflection of the retina very precisely. This could be done with Python. The interpretation of the retina reflex is similar to face recognition, but in a very high defined way. Python will be able to handle the algorithm to calculate the power of the lens of the patient. This algorithm will be dependent on the distance of the camera to the patient’s eye and structure of the reflected image. The result will have the values: sphere, cylinder and axis.

The outcome of this project will be very useful for many people. It will save the vision test standard for optometrists, they will be able to keep a certain standard with a smaller amount of specialists. Furthermore it will solve vision problems for a lot of people in third world contries, since it is easy to operate and to understand.
